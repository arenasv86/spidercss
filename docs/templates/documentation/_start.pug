  .doc-block__description
    p Spider CSS is a powerful SASS and Flexbox framework focused on performance and flexibility for medium and large projects. It isn't another UI Framework like Bootstrap, it just provides common functions, helpers, mixins and some basic UI elements for build webapps.
    p Thanks to SASS you can configure the project with your own variables and generate helpers and tools that make easier the UI development and improve your workflow.
    p Let the game begin!
